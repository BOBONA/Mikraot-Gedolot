# Mikraot-Gedolot
This is a demo for a custom Tanach page formatter in the style of a Mikraot Gedolot. index.html loads a script to automatically fetch the defined sources and format them according to the configuration defined in resources/testFormat.json. 

You will probably want to run a local server to deal with CORS. There is currently no UI but you can change the program parameters at the end of formatter.js.
